After saving the model using:-  saver.save(sess,'./tensorflowModel.ckpt')...

There will be four files:-

1.tensorflowModel.ckpt.meta:  Tenosrflow stores the graph structure separately from the variable values. 
                              The file .ckpt.meta contains the complete graph. It includes GraphDef, SaverDef, and so on.

2.tensorflowModel.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001: This contains the values of variables(weights, biases, placeholders, gradients, hyper-parameters etc).

3.tensorflowModel.ckpt.index: It is a table where Each key is the name of a tensor and its value is a serialized BundleEntryProto.
                              serialized BundleEntryProto holds metadata of the tensors. 
                              Metadata of a tensor may be like: which of the “data” files contains the content of a tensor, the offset into that file, checksum, some auxiliary data, etc.

4.checkpoint:All checkpoint information, like model ckpt file name and path

tensorflowModel.pbtxt:  This holds a network of nodes, each representing one operation, connected to each other as inputs and outputs. 
                        We will use it for freezing our graph. 
                        You can open this file and check if some nodes are missing for debugging purpose.
                        
Difference between .meta files and .pbtxt files:-
Well you can say .pbtxt are human readable whereas .meta files are not. 
But if you keep as_text = false it is no more human readable. 
Still they are different. 
.meta files holds ,more than just the structure of the graph like MetaInfoDef , GraphDef SaverDef , CollectionDef . 
Whereas .pbtxt files holds only the structure of the graph.
